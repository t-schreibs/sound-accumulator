### Lots happening in this little corner of the internet!

While I'm sure this project hasn't even reached v1.0 status yet, this second wave
of updates certainly feels like a v2.0. I've automated some of the heavy lifting
associated with generating entries; I've given the site a bit of a facelift. There's
a new [[locations/0|locations page]] for viewing artists grouped by origin. Entries
are currently heavily skewed toward Portland, Oregon, so if you fancy seeing more of
anywhere else represented on the site, jump in! [[contribute|Contribute to the project]].

31 artists are now represented on Sound Accumulator - wow! It might not seem like much, but it's
a big start, and a happy proof of concept. As far as I'm concerned, the sky's the limit
here.
