Alt-rock,"Alternative rock,Alternative",1970s US and UK,"Bedroom pop,Dream pop,Shoegaze,Crankwave",Alt-rock is a genre of rock music with origins in the US and UK undergrounds of the late '70s.,"Alt-rock is a wide-ranging genre which encompasses many, many subgenres. Its key features - as crystallized over the course of the '90s - are confessional lyrics about social issues, suicide, drug use, and mental health, a focus on expanding beyond the mainstream harmonic palette of the electric guitar, and a tendency toward self-serious melancholy."
Punk,Punk rock,"1970s US, UK, and Australia","Cowpunk,Pop punk",Punk is a music genre and subculture that was originally rooted in the garage rock movement of the '60s.,"Traditional punk is usually defined by its aggressive vocal style, short & up-tempo songs, crunchy guitar sounds, DIY aesthetic, and anti-establishment themes."
Bedroom pop,"Lo-fi,DIY music","1980s-90s lo-fi, 2000s home recording boom",,Bedroom pop is an often poorly-defined genre that emerged in the 2000s as a result of the home recording boom.,"Bedroom pop is generally associated with many of the artefacts of its predecessor, the lo-fi movement of the 80s and 90s - audible noise (tape hiss or otherwise), cultivated amateurism, use of outdated equipment, etc. As artists have worked within and around the genre over the last twenty years, a handful of key aesthetic characteristics have become synonymous with it:
- Heavily chorused-out or otherwise modulate guitars
- Simple beats, whether from a very deadened drum kit or drum machine
- Soft, or at least generally wistful, vocal style and lyrical content, whether rapped or sung
- Use of electric piano-esque or otherwise gentle synthesizer sounds
- Youth"
Dream pop,Dreampop,1980s Ireland & UK,,Dream pop is a genre of music that spawned out of the neo-psychedelia movement in Ireland and the UK in the '70s.,"Though dream pop spawned [[genres/shoegaze | shoegaze]] and often overlaps it stylistically, there are some notable distinctions to be made:
- Where shoegaze relies primarily on distortion and reverb for its sense of space, dream pop is far more likely to rely on chorus and other modulation effects
- Where shoegaze vocalists tend to refrain from extremes of range or dynamics, dream pop singers are far more likely to make use of extended ranges and other more dramatic effects - though both genres seek to create a sense of distance between the singer and the listener that is not characteristic of most other pop music"
Electronica,"Post-rock,Alternative dance,ambient",1990s UK,"Trip hop,Post-classical","Electronica is a general term for a variety of electronic musical subgenres that are intended for personal listening rather than for dancing, though the term is often used ambiguously to describe most or all electronic music.","A less-ambiguous definition of electronica stipulates a genre of music that is generally characterized by:
- An increased focus on ambient or unusual sounds, when compared with EDM
- Often less rigid (or, sometimes, completely absent) propulsive dance beats
- A much wider range of tempos than found in EDM
- Sampling or otherwise integrating sounds & techniques from a wider variety of genres than is typically found in dance music"
Indie pop,,1970s UK,,Indie pop is a subgenre of [[genres/Pop | pop music]] that emerged in the '80s as a response to the increasing commercialization of [[genres/Rock | rock]] and other [[genres/Pop | popular genres]].,
Pop,Popular music,"1950s US, UK","Indie pop,Bedroom pop","Pop music, originally indistinguishable from [[genres/Rock | rock and roll]] in the '50s, is a distinct genre with many subgenres whose defining characteristics are, to some extent, an accumulation of the popular taste of the last 60 years.","Pop music, in its current, simplest form, is largely defined by:
- Verse/chorus song form, with a heavy emphasis placed on melodic hooks
- A focus on the single rather than the LP as the vehicle for releasing and marketing new music
- Song lengths of roughly 3 minutes, which is both radio- and single-friendly
- Generally simple chord changes and musical content, with the emphasis shifted away from the absolute music itself and toward the character of the lead singer

Beginning in the 1990s through into the 2010s, pop music was often distinguished by a heavy use of [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression), mostly in an attempt to sound louder and cleaner than other music, especially when listened to against road noise in a vehicle. However, with the decline of radio, heavily-compressed music is becoming a relic of the past, as digital streaming services have now implemented standards that prioritize music with increased dynamic contrast."
Post-classical,Ambient,1940s France,,Post-classical is a genre of music that experiments with classical music's sonorities within the context of electronic music.,"Post-classical music has its origins in the experimental recordings of French composers such as Pierre Schaeffer, as well as the ""furniture music"" of Erik Satie. Post-classical music is typically defined by its slow tempos, sense of space, use of classical music sonorites (whether sampled, recorded bespoke, or replicated electronically), reliance on a variety of synthesis techniques, and tendency toward minimal structures."
Rock,Rock and roll,1940s-50s US,"Punk,Alt-rock,Fusion","Rock (originally, ""rock and roll"") is a genre of music that was pioneered in the '40s and early '50s by musicians that borrowed from & electrified blues, folk, and other popular musics of the time.","Rock, especially in its early days, is/was largely defined by verse-chorus song form, a focus on the electric guitar & distortion, a metronomic back beat from the drummer, and a harmonic & melodic language inherited from blues, R&B, folk, and country music."
Shoegaze,,1980s Ireland & UK,,Shoegaze is a genre of rock that evolved out of the [[genres/dream-pop | dream pop]] movement of the '80s.,"A number of unique features give shoegaze its distinctive sound within the world of [[genres/alt-rock|alt-rock]]:
- A general feeling of _slowness_, even when tempos are fast; chords remain static or change slowly, and melodies typically avoid large leaps, extremes of range, or other unsubtle tendencies
- A loud, densely-layered guitar soundscape contrasted against a very mellow, subtle vocal style
- Washed-outness, and a general sense of distance, as if the band were farther away from the listener than usual (both physically and metaphorically)

Shoegaze, when understood as a direct response to the overly showy displays of 1980s rock music, is a music of unshowiness, almost of anti-performance. Most shoegaze artists perform nearly motionlessly, and the name of the genre derives from the tendency of its guitarists to stare down at their effects pedals while performing."
