The song is catchy and sweet, and the song's central groove is very bedroom pop-y, though a punk aesthetic materializes as it develops. The band often straddles the apparently thin line between [[genres/Bedroom-pop | bedroom pop]] and [[genres/Punk | punk]] on the album."

Loud, propulsive drums coupled with a repetitive, aggressive motif keep the short track moving forward, and the rapid flow of spoken and yelled lyrics pithced against frenetic, jagged guitar parts provide for a track that is at once in-your-face and tongue-in-cheek."

[[tracks/rotten bun|Rotten Bun]], the opening track, is a work of baroque [[genres/folktronica|folktronica]] with classical aspirations. Making use of minimal, subdued drum machines Ã  la [[artists/jacob mann|Jacob Mann]], many of the album's tracks make use of [[genres/bedroom pop|bedroom pop]] sonorities without succumbing to all of the genre's trappings. At its most reserved, mui zyu's vocal stylings are similar to those of avant-pop luminary [Genevieve Artadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genevieve_Artadi), as is her harmonic language."

In this case, [[tracks/the mould|the mould]] (the second track of the album) is very strange in an exciting way. It is at its best when, listening to it, you realize for the first time that you have no idea where mui zyu is taking you. And this experience remains the album's strength - the various moments when you are taken somewhere even more striking than was promised at the onset of the each track."

Tracks are much longer, to be sure, but they are also developed more carefully, patiently. More samples and effects are employed, because there is far more space for them. ghalani's work is somewhat minimalist in nature, in the sense that orchestrations are often spare and change occurs slowly, but there is plenty to listen for, and the album usually rewards the patient listener. Several of the tracks are strikingly pretty."

Chanting from the 2020 climate march in LA can be heard, and the track closes with the poem ""Let There Be No Regrets"" by Joy Harjo. The overwhelming sentiment is one of grief. ghalani [describes the track as a ""prayer.""](https://thegrowtheternal.bandcamp.com/album/holocene-pyre-ft-joy-harjo)."
