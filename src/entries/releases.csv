BIG AND KIND,NONBINARY GIRLFRIEND,"Punk,Bedroom pop",LP,"February 14, 2023","https://open.spotify.com/album/3pZU03IBAHqn3gqul7Egjp?si=DYWOAd4CTO6vx4Dndn5VtA,https://nonbinarygirlfriend.bandcamp.com/album/big-and-kind","BIG AND KIND is an album released by [[artists/NONBINARY-GIRLFRIEND|NONBINARY GIRLFRIEND]] on February 14, 2023.","BIG AND KIND's title track, and also the band's breakaway hit, is an exhortation to embrace bigness in relationship, to establish boundaries as a form of kindness. The song is catchy and sweet, and the song's central groove is very bedroom pop-y, though a punk aesthetic materializes as it develops. The band often straddles the apparently thin line between [[genres/Bedroom-pop | bedroom pop]] and [[genres/Punk | punk]] on the album."
