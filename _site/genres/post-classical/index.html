<p><p>Post-classical music has its origins in the experimental recordings of French composers such as Pierre Schaeffer, as well as the &quot;furniture music&quot; of Erik Satie. Post-classical music is typically defined by its slow tempos, sense of space, use of classical music sonorites (whether sampled, recorded bespoke, or replicated electronically), reliance on a variety of synthesis techniques, and tendency toward minimal structures.</p>
