  <p><p>Though dream pop spawned <a href="/genres/Shoegaze "> shoegaze</a> and often overlaps it stylistically, there are some notable distinctions to be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where shoegaze relies primarily on distortion and reverb for its sense of space, dream pop is far more likely to rely on chorus and other modulation effects</li>
<li>Where shoegaze vocalists tend to refrain from extremes of range or dynamics, dream pop singers are far more likely to make use of extended ranges and other more dramatic effects - though both genres seek to create a sense of distance between the singer and the listener that is not characteristic of most other pop music</li>
