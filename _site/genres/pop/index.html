  <p><p>Pop music, originally indistinguishable from <a href="/genres/Rock "> rock and roll</a> in the '50s, is a distinct genre with many subgenres whose defining characteristics are, to some extent, an accumulation of the popular taste of the last 60 years.</p>

  <p><p>Pop music, in its current, simplest form, is largely defined by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verse/chorus song form, with a heavy emphasis placed on melodic hooks</li>
<li>A focus on the single rather than the LP as the vehicle for releasing and marketing new music</li>
<li>Song lengths of roughly 3 minutes, which is both radio- and single-friendly</li>
<li>Generally simple chord changes and musical content, with the emphasis shifted away from the absolute music itself and toward the character of the lead singer</li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning in the 1990s through into the 2010s, pop music was often distinguished by a heavy use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression">compression</a>, mostly in an attempt to sound louder and cleaner than other music, especially when listened to against road noise in a vehicle. However, with the decline of radio, heavily-compressed music is becoming a relic of the past, as digital streaming services have now implemented standards that prioritize music with increased dynamic contrast.</p>
