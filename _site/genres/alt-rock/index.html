<p>Alt-rock is a wide-ranging genre which encompasses many, many subgenres. Its key features - as crystallized over the course of the &#39;90s - are confessional lyrics about social issues, suicide, drug use, and mental health, a focus on expanding beyond the mainstream harmonic palette of the electric guitar, and a tendency toward self-serious melancholy.</p>
