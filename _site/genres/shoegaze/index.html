  <p><p>A number of unique features give shoegaze its distinctive sound within the world of <a href="/genres/alt-rock">alt-rock</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A general feeling of <em>slowness</em>, even when tempos are fast; chords remain static or change slowly, and melodies typically avoid large leaps, extremes of range, or other unsubtle tendencies</li>
<li>A loud, densely-layered guitar soundscape contrasted against a very mellow, subtle vocal style</li>
<li>Washed-outness, and a general sense of distance, as if the band were farther away from the listener than usual (both physically and metaphorically)</li>
</ul>
<p>Shoegaze, when understood as a direct response to the overly showy displays of 1980s rock music, is a music of unshowiness, almost of anti-performance. Most shoegaze artists perform nearly motionlessly, and the name of the genre derives from the tendency of its guitarists to stare down at their effects pedals while performing.</p>
