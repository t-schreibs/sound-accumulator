      <h2>22nd May 2024</h2>
<p>The inaugural blog post! Exciting.</p>
<h3>Welcome to Sound Accumulator, your friendly neighborhood music wiki!</h3>
<p>This project has been a labor of love, and I'm so excited to finally see something reasonably interesting emerge from it. I've spent hours researching platforms, designing the site, building automations, cataloging artists. While I know the bulk of the work is by no means behind me, it does feel good to have come this far.</p>
<p>Sound Accumulator is a community space. The <a href="https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator">repo</a> for the project is public, and I encourage anyone and everyone to submit pull requests with entries. I myself will continue to submit entries as well, accompanying each set of uploads with a brief blog entry.</p>
<p>And now, our first batch of artists. 7 so far, with 16 releases between them:</p>
<h4>NY Alt Rock</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/artists/Miss-Grit">Miss Grit</a> - With a powerful voice and an ear for guitary pop hooks, Margaret Sohn explores sci fi and gender (name a more <em>iconic</em> duo) on their debut album.</li>
<li><a href="/artists/Raavi">Raavi</a> - Cool artist that generates catchy indie guitar music. I feel like they'd put on a good live show.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PDX Punks</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="/artists/NONBINARY-GIRLFRIEND">NONBINARY GIRLFRIEND</a> - Ana√Øs Genevieve fronts a psychedelic bedroom punk group that puts on a pretty fun show. I saw them live once at the Lollipop Shoppe. Dramatic and sweet, loud and quiet.</li>
<li><a href="/artists/Sadgasm">Sadgasm</a> - Technically from Salem, Sadgasm mostly play in Portland, hence the inclusion here. My band played a set with them recently - they sounded great live. Punkish emo rock with tempos generally on the slower side.</li>
<li><a href="/artists/combobox">combobox</a> - This is my own band. I play guitar. We're a sort of alt-punk outfit with fast songs.</li>
<li><a href="/artists/Helens">Helens</a> - Not so much a punk band, Helens is nonetheless based out of Portland. They play dreamy shoegaze.</li>
</ul>
