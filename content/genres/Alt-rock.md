## About
Alt-rock is a wide-ranging genre which encompasses many, many subgenres. Its key features - as crystallized over the course of the '90s - are confessional lyrics about social issues, suicide, drug use, and mental health, a focus on expanding beyond the mainstream harmonic palette of the electric guitar, and a tendency toward self-serious melancholy.
