## About
A number of unique features give shoegaze its distinctive sound within the world of [[Alt-rock | alt-rock]]:
- A general feeling of _slowness_, even when tempos are fast; chords remain static or change slowly, and melodies typically avoid large leaps, extremes of range, or other unsubtle tendencies
- A loud, densely-layered guitar soundscape contrasted against a very mellow, subtle vocal style
- Washed-outness, and a general sense of distance, as if the band were farther away from the listener than usual (both physically and metaphorically)

Shoegaze, when understood as a direct response to the overly showy displays of 1980s rock music, is a music of unshowiness, almost of anti-performance. Most shoegaze artists perform nearly motionlessly, and the name of the genre derives from the tendency of its guitarists to stare down at their effects pedals while performing.
