## About
A less-ambiguous definition of electronica stipulates a genre of music that is generally characterized by:
- An increased focus on ambient or unusual sounds, when compared with EDM
- Often less rigid (or, sometimes, completely absent) propulsive dance beats
- A much wider range of tempos than found in EDM
- Sampling or otherwise integrating sounds & techniques from a wider variety of genres than is typically found in dance music
