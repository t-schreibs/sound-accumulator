## About
Though dream pop spawned [[Shoegaze | shoegaze]] and often overlaps it stylistically, there are some notable distinctions to be made:
- Where shoegaze relies primarily on distortion and reverb for its sense of space, dream pop is far more likely to rely on chorus and other modulation effects
- Where shoegaze vocalists tend to refrain from extremes of range or dynamics, dream pop singers are far more likely to make use of extended ranges and other more dramatic effects - though both genres seek to create a sense of distance between the singer and the listener that is not characteristic of most other pop music
