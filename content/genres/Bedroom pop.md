## About
Bedroom pop is generally associated with many of the artefacts of its predecessor, the lo-fi movement of the 80s and 90s - audible noise (tape hiss or otherwise), cultivated amateurism, use of outdated equipment, etc. As artists have worked within and around the genre over the last twenty years, a handful of key aesthetic characteristics have become synonymous with it:
- Heavily chorused-out or otherwise modulate guitars
- Simple beats, whether from a very deadened drum kit or drum machine
- Soft, or at least generally wistful, vocal style and lyrical content, whether rapped or sung
- Use of electric piano-esque or otherwise gentle synthesizer sounds
- Youth
