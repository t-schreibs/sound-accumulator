## About
4-6 was performed as an improvisation on a modular synthesizer. The track features a processed granularized sample on a Make Noise Morphagene and chaotic percussion from a Future Retro Transient Plus.
The track places a single percussive voice againt large, cinematic swells, and is intended as a meditation on loneliness.
