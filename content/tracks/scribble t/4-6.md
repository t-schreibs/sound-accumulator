## About
cinematic swells behind some chaotic percussion. one small construction worker against the sky. a meditation on loneliness. I swear I don't always use this much reverb or this little harmonic content.

synth details
this one's also just two voices:
1. another granularized sample on the Morphagene, this time passed through SSF Stereo Dipole before making its way to MI Beads
2. percussion from the FR Transient Plus chaotically modulated
everything is orchestrated by two EuroPis running the harmonic LFOs script & one running the smooth random voltages script.
