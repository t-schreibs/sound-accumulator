## About
1-5 was performed as an improvisation on a modular synthesizer. The track features a generative patch on an Empress ZOIA and a granularized guitar sample on a Make Noise Morphagene, both heavily processed.
The track was intended to combine the airiness and space of a symphony hall with the intimacy of an old disintegrating tape recording.
