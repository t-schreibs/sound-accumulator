## About
warm, fuzzy blanket of a track. sometimes sounds like a string orchestra on a disintegrating tape, sometimes sounds like a cloud of wobbly synths. occasionally both.

synth details
just 2 voices here, both passing through MI Beads for processing:
1. an elaborate generative patch on the Zoia
2. a granularized guitar sample on the Morphagene
the entire thing is orchestrated by the harmonic LFOs script on the EuroPi
