## About
Helens - originally _Helen_ singular - was initially formed as a thrash metal band. However, by the time of their first released single, they had restructured their sound into a distinct brand of dreamy shoegaze that drew its inspiration from 90s artists like Slowdive as well as [[Dream pop]].
