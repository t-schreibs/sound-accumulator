## About
Over several EPs, Helens has cultivated a distinctive brand of dreamy shoegaze that draws its inspiration from '90s artists like [Slowdive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowdive) as well as [[Dream pop | dream pop]]. Helens' two vocalists sing in a detached, distant manner, while the instruments in the band produce a loud, distorted, often static mass of sound.
