## About
scribble t is a project born out of Tyler Schreiber's developing fascination with hardware synthesis techniques. Tracks range from post-classical soundscape experiments and orchestrated synthesis to folktronica explorations of various song forms.
scribble t is currently developing an interesting audiovisual set and hopes to unveil it, both in live and recorded formats, sometime in the next year.
