## About
Combobox is the brainchild of Tyler Schreiber and Zach Kay; two classically trained musicians who one day decided they wanted to play post-punk. Joined by the ferocious Ben Headwall on drums and the estimable Jack Hopfinger on bass, they combine their sense of humor and tight musicality into a high-energy set guaranteed to get any crowd moving.

Unless the crowd is like, really old and boring or something.
