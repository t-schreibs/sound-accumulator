## Get involved!

Sound Accumulator is always looking for new submissions. Want to feature your band's music? Want to help a local artist out? Enjoy this space and looking for a way to give back? Consider forking the [repository](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator) and submitting a pull request.

## Submission guidelines

>[!info]
>These guidelines are a work in progress - please consult this guide for the latest & greatest before each and every submission.

1. No more than one artist is to be represented in each pull request - this keeps the complexity of review to a minimum
    - Multiple albums and tracks may be submitted per pull request, but they must be associated with a single artist
    - Genre submissions may either be done in separate pull requests, or in the same pull request as an associated artist
2. Artists must _not_ be internationally famous, and even somewhat well-known artists are likely to be rejected
    - This resource is primarily geared toward exposure for small and local acts
    - Does the artist you're looking to submit have more than a million streams on Spotify? They're probably too well-known for Sound Accumulator
    - You have the right to argue on behalf of "gray-area" mid-tier artists, but please be aware that the maintainers are not easily swayed! All final decisions are made with the intent of supporting small & local artists, and this does mean that some submissions might be unexpectedly rejected
    - Rejections are not a form of discipline - we often learn about cool acts through rejected submissions! But they are used to help keep the site focused
3. Submissions should closely follow the [templates provided in the repository](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content/templates)
    - Replace parenthesized text with content
    - Where the words "link" or "links" are included in the parenthesized text, provide [markdown links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) as appropriate
        - Internal links (meaning, links across Sound Accumulator) should be handled with shortened paths as follows:
            - folder/filename.md
            - Replace any spaces in the filename with "%20"
            - E.g., `[Trip hop](genres/Trip%20hop.md)`
    - Unused rows from the info tables may be removed, but please don't add new rows - any additional information should be submitted in the "About" section
4. All submissions should be placed in the correct folder
    - Submissions live in subfolders of the [content folder](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content):
        - Artists in [content/artists](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content/artists)
        - Albums in [content/albums](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content/albums)
        - Tracks in [content/tracks](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content/tracks)
        - Genres in [content/genres](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/tree/hugo/content/genres)
4. Focus on linking!
    - While there are defined sections for certain kinds of links (genre links in the info tables, links in the "Similar tracks" section at the bottom of track submissions, etc.), internal links should be peppered liberally throughout the "Intro" and "About" sections of any submission
    - Links are how users find music on this site - without links, your submissions will disappear into the void
5. Keep the tone concise and generally neutral, but a degree of conversationality is permitted, and fun & interesting comparisons to other artists, albums, tracks, or genres are condoned and even encouraged
    - Keep opinions to the [discussion boards](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/discussions) - Sound Accumulator is not a review site
6. All submissions must at a minimum meet the Quartz [citizen code of conduct](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator/blob/hugo/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) - and that goes for both the music/artists submitted and the way in which they are represented
    - This site is not Wikipedia, and its intention is not to catalog all notable music
    - Sound Accumulator is committed to fostering an open & inclusive community of audiophiles, while increasing exposure for small & local artists

## FAQ

### Can I include images in my submissions?

Image files may not be included in pull requests, and will be removed. Sound Accumulator is a text and link-based site, and images are far too expensive in terms of both performance and storage. However, links to media on other sites are encouraged, such as to [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com).

### Will an artist that has become too popular for Sound Accumulator have their submissions removed?

Currently, there's no plan for this to happen, but if it does start to become a repeat problem, a process will likely be instituted to "graduate" artists from the platform.

### How do I become a maintainer for the project?

When a need is determined by the current maintainers to increase capacity, contributers with the most activity will be considered.

### Are pull requests accepted for core site functionality?

Yes, but please keep in mind that the site is built to be simple and fast - anything that compromises either of these aims will likely be rejected.
