### Welcome to Sound Accumulator, your friendly neighborhood music wiki! 

This project has been a labor of love, and I'm so excited to finally see something reasonably interesting emerge from it. I've spent hours researching platforms, building automations, cataloging artists. While I know the bulk of the work is by no means behind me, it does feel good to have come this far.

Sound Accumulator is a community space. The [repo](https://github.com/t-schreibs/sound-accumulator) for the project is public, and I encourage anyone and everyone to submit pull requests with entries. I myself will continue to submit entries as well, and will accompany each batch of uploads with a brief blog entry. I expect this will result in some interesting connections across various nodes in the graph that might not otherwise have materialized. 

And, speaking of the graph, I encourage you to use it to rabbit hole. Why is _this_ connected to _that_? What is this lonely page doing over here? Wow, there are so many things attached to this specific genre! Lots of fun to be had.

Speaking of fun, we have our first batch of artists. I believe we're up to ((())) so far, representing a total of ((())) genres:

#### NY Alt Rock

- [[Miss Grit]] - With a powerful voice and 
- [[Raavi]] - 

#### PDX Punk

- [[NONBINARY GIRLFRIEND]] - Ana√Øs Genevieve fronts a psychedelic bedroom punk group that puts on a pretty fun show. I saw them live once at the Lollipop Shoppe.
- [[Sadgasm]] - technically from Salem, they mostly play in Portland, hence the inclusion here. Played a set with them recently - they sounded great live.
- [[Combobox]] - This is my own band. I play guitar. We're a sort of alt-punk outfit with fast songs.
