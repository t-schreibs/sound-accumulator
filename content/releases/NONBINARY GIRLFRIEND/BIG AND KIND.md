## About
BIG AND KIND's title track, and also the band's breakaway hit, is an exhortation to embrace bigness in relationship, to establish boundaries as a form of kindness. The song is catchy and sweet, and the song's central groove is very bedroom pop-y, though a punk aesthetic materializes as it develops. The band often straddles the apparently thin line between [[Bedroom pop | bedroom pop]] and [[Punk | punk]] on the album.
